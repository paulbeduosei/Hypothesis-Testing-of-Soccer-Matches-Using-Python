# Hypothesis-Testing-of-Soccer-Matches-Using-Python
This project was built around a core hypothesis: Do women’s international soccer matches feature more goals than men’s? I filtered for World Cup matches post-2002, tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk, and used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare distributions. The conclusion? 🎉 Women’s matches statistically score more goals.

As a lifelong ⚽️ soccer fan, I've always loved digging into the game's stats and stories. This time, I turned my passion into a hypothesis-driven analysis.

I noticed something intriguing while watching international tournaments: women’s matches often feel more high-scoring than men’s. So I asked myself — is that just my perception, or does the data back it up?

Using official FIFA World Cup match data since 2002, I ran a formal hypothesis test comparing total goals in men’s and women’s games.

📊 Result? At a 10% significance level, women’s matches do have significantly more goals on average than men’s. The stats don't lie!

Whether you're a sports fan, analyst, or data enthusiast — this kind of insight shows how data can confirm (or challenge) what we think we know about the game we love.
