# Hypothesis-Testing-of-Soccer-Matches-Using-Python
This project was built around a core hypothesis: Do women’s international soccer matches feature more goals than men’s? I filtered for World Cup matches post-2002, tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk, and used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare distributions. The conclusion? 🎉 Women’s matches statistically score more goals.
